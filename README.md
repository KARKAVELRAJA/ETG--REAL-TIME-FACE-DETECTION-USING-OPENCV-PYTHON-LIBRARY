# ETG--REAL-TIME-FACE-DETECTION-USING-OPENCV-PYTHON-LIBRARY

### PYTHON CODE TO DETECT AND BLUR THE REAL-TIME FACE USING OPENCV-PYTHON LIBRARY

- Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images or through the real-time cameras
- In this project, at first the necessary python libraries are imported
- Then, the camera resource is activated and the frames from it are read by using read() function in opencv library
- Next the model is trained using "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" file and the real-time frames obtained from the camera is fed into the model for prediction
- Finally, the output frame with blur on the face is displayed on the window using imshow() function in opencv library

-----

### FILES

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml - used for training the model
